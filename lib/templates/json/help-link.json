  "description": "The link functionality allows developers to easily test their libraries.\nLinking is a two-step process.\n\nUsing 'racoon link' in a project folder will create a global link.\nThen, in some other library, 'racoon link <name>' will create a link in the components folder pointing to the previously created link.\n\nThis allows to easily test a library because changes will be reflected immediately.\nWhen the link is no longer necessary, simply remove it with 'racoon uninstall <name>'.",
